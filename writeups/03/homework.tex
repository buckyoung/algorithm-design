\begin{homeworkProblem}
\centerline{\textbf{Problem 6}}
\leavevmode
\\ \\
\textbf{(a)}
\\
\textbf{Input:} An ordered sequence of words $S = \{w_1, w_2, ... , w_n\}$ where the length of the $i^{th}$ word is $w_i$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Output:} Total penalty P as described by the problem statement ($\Sigma P_i$ for each $P_i = K_i - L$) such that P is minimized. 
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} The given greedy algoirthm G correctly solves this problem.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof:} 
Assume to reach a contradiction that there exists some input I on which G produces an unacceptable output. Let OPT be the optimal solution that agrees with G for the most number of steps. Let the first disagreance be word $w_{L_k}$ on line $k$. The only way OPT can disagree with G is if OPT moves $w_{L_k}$ to a new line and G does not (obviously G wont fail to place a word on a line that it is able to).
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
Let OPT' be a modified version of OPT, such that with the first word on each new line ($w_{L_k}, w_{L_{k+1}}, ..., w_{L_n}$) each moved to the previous line if possible. The logic governing moving the first word on the $i^{th}$ line up to the $(i-1)^{th}$ line is as follows.
\\ \\
\begin{tabbing}
\ if $w_i <= (L - K_{i-1})$:

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\textbf{(b)}
\textbf{Input:} An ordered sequence of words $S = \{w_1, w_2, ... , w_n\}$ where the length of the $i^{th}$ word is $w_i$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Output:} Total penalty P as described by the problem statement (the maximum of the line penalties) such that P is minimized.
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} The given greedy algorithm G correctly solves this problem.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof:} Consider OPT as a counter-example to prove G incorrect.
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
Clearly $P_G$ $\textgreater$ $P_{OPT}$. Since we want to minimize P, OPT is correct.
\\ \\
$\therefore$ Greedy algorithm G is not correct by way of this counter-example.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\centerline{\textbf{Problem 5}}
\leavevmode
\\ \\
\textbf{(a)}
\\
\textbf{Input:} Locations $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ of gas stations along a highway.
\\ \\
\textbf{Output:} Stoppage time at each station which minimizes the total time which you are stopped for gas.
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} The given "next-station" algorithm (NS) is correct / optimal.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof:} Assume to reach a contradiction that there exists an input on which NS produces an unacceptable output.
\\ \\
Let $S_i$ be the stoppage time at each station
\\ \& NS(I)=\{$S_{\alpha(1)}$, $S_{\alpha(2)}$, ..., $S_{\alpha(n)}$\} be the output of NS on input I
\\ \& OPT(I)=\{$S_{\beta(1)}$, $S_{\beta(2)}$, ..., $S_{\beta(n)}$\} be the optimal solution that agrees with NS(I) the most number of steps
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
Let $x_k$ be the first stop of the trip upon which NS(I) differs from OPT(I)
\\ \\ By the definition of NS, filling up for any time less than $S_\alpha(k)$ would not get you to the next station and since $S_{\alpha(k)}$ $\neq$ $S_{\beta(k)}$, then we know that $S_{\beta(k)}$ $\textgreater$ $S_{\alpha(k)}$
\\ \\ Let time t be defined as the difference between those stoppage times, t = $S_{\beta(k)}$ - $S_{\alpha(k)}$
\\ \\ Therefore $S_{\beta(k)}$ = $S_{\alpha(k)}$ + t:
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
Let OPT'(I) = OPT(I) with time t shifted to the next stop: 
\\
\centerline{$S'_k$ = $S_k$ - t}
\centerline{$S'_{k+1}$ = $S_{k+1} + t$}
\\ \\ Clearly, we haven't changed the total stoppage time and we know that we can reach the next stop by the definition of NS. Furthermore we add the difference to the stop at $x_{k+1}$, so we will undoubtably be able to reach the station at $x_{k+2}$ -- and all future stations. 
\\ \\ $\therefore$ We have reached a contradiction because OPT' agrees with NS for one additional step despite OPT being defined as agreeing with NS for the most number of steps.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\textbf{(b)}
\\
\textbf{Input:} Locations $x_1$, ..., $x_n$ of gas stations along a highway.
\\ \\
\textbf{Output:} Stoppage time at each station which minimizes the total time which you are stopped for gas.
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} The given "fill-up" algorithm (FU) is not correct or optimal.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof:}
\\
\\ Consider the input I = $\{x_1, x_2\}$ where $x_2 - x_1$ = $\frac{1}{2} \frac{C}{F}$ 
\\ \\ Note that to reach $x_2$ from $x_1$ it would take $F(x_2 - x_1) = F(\frac{1}{2} \frac{C}{F}) = \frac{1}{2} C$ liters of gas
\\ \\ At $x_1$ the tank is filled to capacity according to FU, taking $\frac{C}{r}$ minutes. But it is possible and correct to reach $x_2$ using only $\frac{1}{2}C$ liters, making the optimal time $\frac{1}{2} \frac{C}{r}$ minutes.
\\ \\ $\therefore$ FU is not correct or optimal.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\centerline{\textbf{Problem 5}}
\leavevmode
\\ \\
\textbf{(a)} 
\\
\textbf{Input:} A set of n points on the real line A where $a_i$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$.
\\ \\
\textbf{Output:} Minimum cardinality collection S of unit intervals that cover every point in A.
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} The "farthest in the future" algorithm F is correct.
\\ \\
\textbf{Proof:} Assume to reach a contraction that there exists input I on which F produces unacceptable output.
\\ \\
Let F(I)=\{$P_{\alpha(1)}$, $P_{\alpha(2)}$, ..., $P_{\alpha(n)}$\} be the output of F on input I
\\ \& OPT(I)=\{$P_{\beta(1)}$, $P_{\beta(2)}$, ..., $P_{\beta(n)}$\} be the optimal solution that agrees with F(I) the most number of steps
\\ \\
Consider the first point of disagreement k between OPT and F
\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 
Let OPT' equal OPT with $P_{\alpha(k)}$ chosen at k instead of $P_{\beta(k)}$
\\ \\
Clearly OPT' is more similar to F (for one additional step)
\\ \\
To show that OPT' is still correct, consider the four possible cases for input I:
\\ \\
\centerline{Case 1}
\\ \\ \\ \\ 
In this case, neither $P_{\alpha(k)}$ nor $P_{\beta(k)}$ exist in the input after time-step k. Therefore $|E|$ and $|E'|$ do not change.
\\ \\
\centerline{Case 2}
\\ \\ \\ \\ 
In this case, only $P_{\beta(k)}$ exists in the input after time-step k. Since $P_{\beta(k)}$ is needed at some point in the future (and OPT has evicted it at time-step k), OPT is guaranteed to need at least one additional eviction. Therefore $|E|$ \textgreater $|E'|$.
\\ \\
\centerline{Case 3}
\\ \\ \\ \\ 
In this case, both $P_{\alpha(k)}$ and $P_{\beta(k)}$ exist in the input after time-step k. Therefore $|E|$ must account for an eviction to bring $P_{\beta(k)}$ back into fast memory and $|E'|$ must account for an eviction to bring $P_{\alpha(k)}$ back into fast memory.  
\\ \\
\centerline{Case 4}
\\ \\ \\ \\ 
In this case, only $P_{\alpha(k)}$ exists in the input after time-step k. By the definition of F, if $P_{\beta(k)}$ did not exist in the input after time-step k then F would have chosen it. Therefore this is an impossible state.
\\ \\
In all cases, $|E|$ $\geq$ $|E'|$. Therefore (since we are minimizing) OPT $\leq$ OPT'
\\ \\ $\therefore$ We have reached a contradiction because OPT' agrees with F for one additional step (and still produces a correct output) despite OPT being defined as agreeing with F for the most number of steps.
